Playing With Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses Using Python

In this repo, we generete 10000 random IP using the randIPgen.py
and write it to a file iplist.txt.

The generate IP addresses are ping-ed one by one using pingList.py.

The active hosts (IP addresses) are written to a file active.txt
and those inactive hosts are written to the file inactive.txt.
